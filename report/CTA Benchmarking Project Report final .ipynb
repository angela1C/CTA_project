    "\n",
    "In this section I introduce the concept of sorting algorithms, discussing the relevance of concepts such as time and space complexity, performance, in-place sorting, stable sorting, comparator functions, comparison-based and non-comparison-based sorts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much reference is made here to lecture notes for the Computational Thinking with Algorithms at GMIT [1], the book Algorithms in a Nutshell by George T. Heineman, Gary Pollice and Stanley Selkow [2] and also the online book [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/index.html)[3].\n",

    "[Sorting](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sorting) is the process or operation of ordering items and data according to specific criteria. Arranging items, whether manually or digitally into some order makes many common tasks easier to do. Sorted information is nearly always easier for human beings to understand and work with, whether it is looking up a number in a phone book, finding a book in a library or bookshop shelf, referring to statistical tables, deciding what to watch on television. It is even more applicable with technology. Social media and news feeds, emails, search items in a browser or recommendations for where to eat and what to do are all sorted according to some algorithms whether it is by date, popularity, location or some other criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many computations and tasks are simplified and made more efficient by having the data sorted in advance, such as searching for an item, checking for duplicate items, determining the smallest and largest values, or the most common or least common values. Sorting is a common operation in many computer applications and the search for efficient sorting algorithms dominated the early days of computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to [Algorithms to live by The Computer Science of Human Decisions](Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths)[4], sorting is at the very heart of what computers do and is what actually brought computers into being in the first place. The task of tabulating the US Census in the late nineteenth century became very difficult as the population grew. An inventor by the name of Herman Hollerith was inspired by the punched railway tickets of the time to devise a system of punched cards and a machine (the Hollerith Machine) to count and sort them. This system was then used for the 1890 census. Hollerith's company later merged with others in 1911 to become the Computing Tabulating Recording Company which was later renamed to International Business Machines (IBM). \n",
    "Sorting then lay behind the development of the computer in the 20th century. By the 1960's it was estimated by one study that more than a quarter of the world's computing resouces were spent on sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm is a set of rules to obtain the expected output from the given input. A computer programming task can be broken down into two main steps - writing the algorithm as an ordered sequence of steps that can be used to solve the problem and then implementing the sequenced of steps in a programming language such as Python so that the machine can run the algorithm. While humans can usually follow algorithms that are not very precise in order to accomplish a task, this is not the case for computers and therefore algorithms have to be written very precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "As there are many different ways that algorithms could be designed to achieve a similar goal, there needs to be some way of deciding which particular algorithm is preferable for a particular use. A well-designed algorithm should produce the correct solution for a given input using computational resources efficiently. It should have well defined inputs and outputs and the algorithm should end after a finite number of steps. Every step of the algorithm should be precisely defined so that there is no ambiguity as a computer after all can only do what it has been instructed to do.\n",
    "While an algorithm should always produce a correct solution (or in some cases correct within an acceptable margin of error) it should also be feasible giving the computational resources available such as processing power, memory, storage etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms vary in their space and time efficiency, even those that have the same purpose such as sorting algorithms. \n",
    "While space efficiency looks at the amount of memory or storage needed, time efficiency looks at the effect of the input data on the run time or number of operations needed to run the algorithm.\n",
    "An algorithms efficiency can be analysed in two different ways. A priori analysis looks at the efficiency of an algorithm from a more theoretical perspective without being concerned with the actual implementation on any particular machine.\n",
    "The relative efficiency of algorithms is analysed by comparing their *order of growth* with respect to the size of the input ($n$) and is a measure of **complexity**. The order of growth refers to how the size of the resource requirements increase as a function of the input size.  As input size increases so too does the number of operations required and the work required.\n",
    "Complexity is a measure of an algorithm’s efficiency with respect to internal factors, such as the time needed to run an algorithm and is a feature of the steps in the algorithms rather than the actual implementation of the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "A posteriori analysis, on the other hand, is a measure of the **performance** of an algorithm and evaluates efficiency empirically, comparing algorithms implemented on the same target platform to get their relative efficiency.\n",
    "Performance depends on the actual computer resources such as time, memory, disk, speed, compiler etc required to run a specific algorithm. Performance does not affect complexity but complexity can affect performace as the algorithm's design will feed into how the code is written and implemented. The runtime of sorting algorithms can be measured by measuring the actual implementation of the algorithm using a timer function like pythons `timeit` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While the speed of an algorithm to complete is one of the most important factors when choosing one algorithm over another, as this will highly depend on the platform on which it is run on you cannot really compare algorithms that are run on different machines with different capabilities to come to conclusions about the algorithm in general. For this reason the concept of complexity is analysed mathematically allowing algorithms to be compared by looking at their running time as a function of the input data size and in this way see which algorithms will scale well. \n",
    "Algorithmic complexity looks at how the resource requirements grow as the input size increases, how the time required (as well as memory and storage) increases as the number of inputs increase and typically falls into one of a number of growth families.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big $O$ notation is generally used as a measure of theoretical runtime complexity - of the expected efficiency of an algorithm. Big $O$ represents the relationship between the size of the input $n$ and the number of operations the algorithm takes and shows how quickly the runtime grows as the input size increases. It is usually used to describe the complexity of an algorithm in the worst-case scenario. While computer algorithms might be considered efficient for small input sizes as the size becomes non-trivial then the order or growth of an algorithm will become more and more important.\n",
    "When using Big $O$ notation, the tightest upper bounds are indentified. It always assumes the upper limit where the algorithm has to perform the maximum number of operations.\n",
    "While two algorithms might have the same Big $O$ notation, this does not mean they will execute in exactly the same times, but that the order of the number of operations that they will require to complete will be the same. An algorithm with a less complex Big $O$ than another is usually considered much more efficient in terms of space and time requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Omega$ (Omega) notation is used to describe the complexity of an algorithm in the best case and represents the lower bounds on the number of possible operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Theta$ (Theta) notation is used to specify that the running time of an algorithm is no greater or less than a certain order. For example, an algorithm is considered $\\Theta(n)$ if it is both $O(n)$ and $\\Omega(n)$ which means the growth in it's execution time is no better or worse  than the order specified. \n",
    "\n",
    "- An $O(1)$ algorithm always executes in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.\n",
    "- An $O(n)$ algorithm is one whose worst case performance grows linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. \n",
    "- An $O(n^2)$ algorithm is one whose worst case performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data and is common with algorithms using nested iterations over the input data set\n",
    "- Deeper nested iterations result in higher orders such as $O(n^3)$, $O(n^4)$ etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The various sorting algorithms differ from each other in their memory requirements which depends on how the actual algorithm works. When a sorting algorithm is run, it has to first read the input data from a storage location to the computers RAM. An **in-place** sorting algorithm is one that only uses a fixed additional amount of working space, no matter what the input size whereas other sorting algorithms may require additional working memory  which is often related to the input size. If there is limited memory available then in-place sorting is desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm), *in computer science, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm which transforms input using no auxiliary data structure. However a small amount of extra storage space is allowed for auxiliary variables. The input is usually overwritten by the output as the algorithm executes. In-place algorithm updates input sequence only through replacement or swapping of elements. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Some algorithm create empty arrays to hold sorted copies and this requires more memory as the size of the input increases. In-place sorting does not require additional arrays as the relative position of the elements are swapped within the array to be sorted and therefore additional memory should not be required. By producing the sorted output in the same memory space as the input data to be sorted avoids the need to use double the space. A sorting algorithm will still need some extra storage for working variables though.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sorting algorithm is considered **comparison-based** if the only way to gain information about the total order is by comparing a pair of elements at a time using comparator operators to see which of the two elements should appear first in the sorted list. Comparison based sorts do not make any assumptions about the data and compare all the elements against each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers and single characters can be quite easily sorted while composite elements such as strings of characters usually sort each individual element of the string.  Two elements can be compared to each other to see if they are less than, greater than or equal to each other. Sorting of custom objects may require a custom ordering scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Algorithms in a Nutshell[2], if a collection of comparable elements\n",
    "$A$ is presented to be sorted in place where $A[i]$ and $ai$ refer to the ith element in the collection with $A[0]$ being the first element in the collection, then to sort the collection the elements $A$ must be reorganised so that if $A[i] < A[j]$, then $i < j$. Any duplicate elements must be contiguous in the resulting ordered collection. This means that if $A[i] = A[j]$ in a sorted collection, then there can be no $k$ such that $i < k < j$ and $A[i] \\neq A[k]$. Finally, the sorted collection A must be a permutation of the elements that originally formed $A$. The book also outlines how the elements in the collection being compared must admit a total ordering. That is, for any two elements p and q in a collection, exactly one of the following three predicates is true: `p = q`, `p < q`, or `p > q`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computing in general a comparator function compares the elements $p$ to $q$ and returns 0 if $p$ = $q$, a negative number if $p$ < $q$, and a positive number if $p > q$. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "Simple sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort are comparison-based sorts.  On the other hand, there are other sorting algorithms such as Counting Sort, Bucket Sort and Radix Sort which do make some assumptions about the data. These type type of algorithms consider the distribution of the data and the range of values that the data falls into and in doing so avoiding the need to compare all elements to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stability** means that equivalent elements will retain their relative positioning after the sorting has taken place. With a stable sorting algorithm the order of equal elements is the same in both the input and output\n",
    "A sorting algorithm is considered stable if two objects with equal keys end up in the same order in the sorted output as they appear in the input. An unstable algorithm does not pay attention to the relationship between element locations in the original collection and does not guarantee the relative ordered will be kept after the sorting has taken place. [4]\n",
    "\n",
    "Stability is an important factor to consider when sorting key value pairs where the data might contain duplicate keys. There are many applications of sorting where the data has more than one dimension, in which case the data is sorted based on one column of data known as the key. The rest of the data is known as satellite data and should travel with the key when it is moved to another position.\n",
    "If two elements a<sub>i</sub> and a<sub>i</sub> in the original unsorted data are equal as determined by the comparator function used, stable sorting refers to the fact such pairs of equal elements will retain their relative ordering after the sorting has taken place. If $i$ < $j$ then the final location of  a<sub>i</sub> must be to the left of a<sub>j</sub>. Sorting algorithms that can guarantee this property are considered stable.[2]\n"

    "Bubble Sort is a fairly simple comparison-based sorting algorithm and is so named for the way larger values in a list “bubble up” to the end as sorting takes place. The algorithm repeatedly goes through the list to be sorted, comparing and swapping adjacent elements that are out of order.  With every new pass through the data, the next largest element bubbles up towards it's correct position. Although it is quite simple to understand and to implement, it is slow and impractical for most problems apart from situations where the data is already nearly sorted.\n",

Then the elements `11` and `9` are compared and swapped resulting in `[6, 3, 9, 11 ,4]`, then `11` and `4` are swapped. At the start of the second pass, the array is now `[6,3,9,11,4]`.

Seward in 1954, is an algorithm for sorting a collection of objects according to keys that are small integers. It is an integer sorting algorithm that counts the number of objects that have each distinct key value, and using arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence.\n",
    "\n",

In this way the need to compare all elements against each other is avoided. Counting Sort allows for a collection of items to be sorted in close to linear time which is made possible by making assumptions about the type of data to be sorted.\n",

    "The Counting Sort algorithm uses `keys` between a specific range and counts the number of objects having distinct key values. To implement it you first need to determine the maximum value in the range of values to be sorted which is then used to define the `keys`. The keys are all the possible values that the data to be sorted can take. An auxillary array is created to store the count of the number of times each key value occurs in the input data. \n",

For example if it comes across the value 3 in the array to be sorted, go to index 3 of the counter array and increment the value in index 3 by 1. If the value 3 is encountered again, increment the value of the counter at index 3 by 1. This records the number of times the number 3 occurs in the input data.

It does not however need the extra memory that Merge Sort requires.  A `pivot` element is used to divide the list for the recursive calls to the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Quicksort algorithm was developed by Tony Hoare in 1959. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) the QuickSort algorithm is also known as the partition-exchange sort and when implemented well, it can be about two or three times faster than its main competitors, merge sort and heapsort.\n",

    "The first pivot element is 54 at index 0. The algorithm places a pointer at the next element 25 and passes over the elements in the array from left to right until it finds the first element which is greater than the pivot value, in this case 92. Another pointer is placed at the very last element in the array. Moving left from this position until the first element is found that is less than the pivot value. This is the very last element itself 92. The two out of place elements are swapped resulting in `[54,25,20,16,76,30,43,55,92]`. Again moving right until the first element greater than the pivot value is found 76 while moving left from the last element until the first element less than the pivot is found at 43. This results in the values 76 and 43 being swapped. Starting again from the pivot `[54,25,20,16,43,30,76,55,92]` and moving right to find the first element greater than the pivot which is 76. At the same time moving left from the end of the array to find the first element less than the pivot is 30. However as the first value smaller than the pivot (from the end of the array) is positioned before the first value greater than the pivot from the beginning, the algorithm stops. The pivot value 54 is swapped with the value 30 resulting in `[30,25,20,16,43,54,76,55,92]`. The pivot value is now in it's correct and final position in the sorted array.\n",

The QuickSort algorithm is then recursively called on the two halves `[30,25,20,16,43]` and `[76,55,92]` using the first element in each subarray as the pivot. \n",
    "Taking the first half `[30,25,20,16,43]`, the first pivot is 30, then once it is placed in it's final position the pivot of the next sub-array `[16,25,20]` is 16, the next pivot is 25.\n",

Insertion Sort here takes about half the time as Bubble Sort. Merge Sort and Quick Sort and Merge Sort have times of the same order.\n",

    "The benchmarking in this project looked specifically at the time complexity of the 5 mentioned sorting algorithms. The times were measured and compared to each other and to the expected results given in the studies. The actual times depended on various factors specific to the machine on which they were implemented and therefore the numbers will not match the results other studies might report, given the differences on which they are run.\n",

While the results in this benchmarking project showed the Counting Sort algorithm as being the fastest, it should be noted that the performance of the Counting Sort algorithm does decrease when the values to be sorted are large.\n",

    "As well as the size of the input, the characteristics of the data may also have an effect on the running time. For this benchmarking project, although different random arrays were used for each run, the characteristics of the data remained the same and the average results used.\n",

    "When the averages of all five sorting algorithms are plotted, it is clear than Counting Sort is a far faster sorting algorithm than the two simple sorting algorithms Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort. Insertion sort outperforms Bubble Sort in terms of speed but they are still of the same order of magnitude with a growth rate of $n^2$. This is expected average case complexity which occurs when the data provided is in random order as it was here.\n",
